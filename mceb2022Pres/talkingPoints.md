### Talking points

## About me

## Quick Summary
- Dates \equiv epi, seq -> evo information
- Add preprint note
- Touch on bd. Maybe graph methods

## Breakdown
- Backrgound - why?
- How
- Validating method
- Appropriate context

## Origins
- Aus context, hieght sampling
- But lots of identical sequences. How much do we need those sampling times?
- Often using BD model b/c high sampling proportion
- Some clusters more sampled than others - how to best spread our efforts?

## How do we isolte signal then?
- Insert table

## How do we isolate cont.
- Give graphical example

## What does our output look like?
- Try hands up exercise maybe? Who thinks different posterior dists will occupy same domains?
- Figure of examples.
- Talk through how many different configurations fall out
- Touch on measuring the differences between. Initally entropy assuming a shared domain

## Comparing
- Introduce wasserstein
- Mention measured pairwise bwtween curves

## Give intuition with discrete example
- Mention cost

## Give examples

## Visualising.
- Mention the plane, maybe show which wasserstein get put in from figures
-Walk through examples, mentioning classification and boundary

## Validate with simulation study
- Give study Breakdown

## Data on Plane
- Show dist
- Consistent with work on dates under bd

## Site Patterns
- Discuss pattern of low site patterns and nec/insuff condition ideas

## Date patterns
- Define
- No pattern

## Sampling effects √
- Bring slide up

## Final perspective fig
 - Start with inital √
 - Then show whole 2021

## Acknowledgements

## Outstanding to do:
- check figure legend
- add graph methods
- add bd notes
